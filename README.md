## Description

  This is my implementation of solar system done within the coursework on the subject "3D graphics". It has written in C++ using OpenGL API and auxiliary libraries like GLEW, GLFW, GLM, ASSIMP, etc. It uses high resolution textures for more attractiveness and usefulness. Moreover there's created a model loader of files with .obj extension and a correct file path that means you can even load your own models if you play a bit with the code.:sparkles:

## Functionality
- Rendering of 3D space
- Space objects loading
- Free movement and inspection
- Zooming
- Posibility to read information about objects

## Conclusion
  Thus, I may say that this application is prefered for using in educational and/or entertaining purposes.
